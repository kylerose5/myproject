# myproject

  Here is some of my Linux Lab work with Python Automation task such as iterating over files in a directory or checking file naming criterita.[see "Python Automation.py"] On the network security side, I created a Linux script that essentially pings every possible IP adress on your particular subnet to see how many devices are "Alive." Also, I shared some of my CompTIA Security + exam study materials such as firewall configuration and modificaiton. 
More to come!!!
