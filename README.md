# myproject

  I really enjoy coding in python and practing how to write efficent lines of code to automate IT related task, such as iterating over files in a directory or checking to see if files are meeting naming criterita. You can see some examples in my "Python Automating.py" file. Also, I have some of my ethical hacking lab materials that I am currently wokring on. For example, I created a Linux script that essentially pings every possible IP adress on your particular subnet. This is a great automation that can tell you how many devices are "Alive" on your network. Lastly, I shared some of my Security + exam study materials such as firewall configuration and modificaiton. 
More to come!!!
