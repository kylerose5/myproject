# myproject
Added some of my ethical hacking lab materials that I am currently wokring on. For example, I created a script that essentially pings every possible IP adress on your particular subnet. This is a great automation that can tell you how many devices are "Alive" on your network. Also, shared some past study material for the security + exam for firewall configuration and changes. 
More to come!!!
