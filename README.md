# myproject
A cyber security analyst is as good as his knowledge and the vast toolkit under his belt. I shared some of my Linux Lab work with Python Automation task such as iterating over files in a directory or checking file naming criteria.[see "Python Automation.py"] On the network security side, I created a Linux script that essentially pings every possible IP address on your particular subnet to see how many devices are "Alive." In another lab I used a vulnerability scanner called Nessus to make sure systems were hardened such as Apache web servers.  Also, I shared some of my CompTIA Security + exam study materials such as firewall configuration and modification. 
More to come!!!
