  Here is some of my Linux Lab work with Pyton Automation task such as iterating over files in a directory or checking file naming criterita.[see "Python Automation.py"] On the network secuirty side I created a Linux script that essentially pings every possible IP adress on your particular subnet to see how many devices are "Alive" on your network. Also, I shared some of my Security + exam study materials such as firewall configuration and modificaiton. 
More to come!!!
